- MVVM Architecture: The application is structured based on the Model-View-ViewModel architectural pattern. This promotes separation of concerns and enhances maintainability.
- JSON API: The application fetches cryptocurrency data from a JSON API, ensuring that users receive up-to-date information.
- Combine Framework: The Combine framework, introduced by Apple, is a powerful tool for managing asynchronous events and data streams in Swift applications. It provides a declarative Swift API for processing values over time, which is particularly useful in modern iOS development.
